# React App Boilerplate

<img alt="Logo" align="right" src="https://create-react-app.dev/img/logo.svg" width="20%" />

Inspired from [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) concept, but with simpler another configuration approach which supports typescript, eslint, scss from start. I created this because I need full control most of the times, so this boilerplate alwasy works best for me.


## Features

- Uses webpack 5 and latest version of everything.
- It doesn't use babel or babel related packages.
- It has HMR (hot module reloading)
- No Yarn warnings

## Installation

```sh
git clone git@github.com:fatihgozenc/create-react-app.git
cd create-react-app
yarn
```

You **donâ€™t** need to install or configure tools like webpack or Babel.<br>
They are preconfigured so that you can focus on the code.

## TODO's

- Develeoping further for future updates, warn messages and unseen bugs.
- Maybe add as an executable for `yarn create`
